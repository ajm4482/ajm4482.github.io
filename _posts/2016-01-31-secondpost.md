This Past Week I started my project for the class towards the beginning of the week, I am glad to say I havent run into a significant problems except for Sphere; which I have postponed working with. The quizzes for this week weren't the greatest, I was not expecting that detailed of question so for next week, I will make sure two read the readings twice! I am taking one other Computer Science class and it seems like it will have a heavier workload than any of my other classes, Information Security Product Development. Sigh.

Currently in my way is the major project plan my other class is asking for. It is supposed to be a detailed project plan that describes how we are supposed to approach our problem for the entire semester and they only gave us five days to work on it. I suppose thats my priority right now.

Next week, I believe, is the dreaded Spring career fair and, however greatful I am that our University has it for us, it is always so tiring and not something I look forward to. I do need an internship for the summer though and it is the perfect place to build up my experience. Finishing up my Collatz project is also on my to-do list and submitting that cursed project plan. 

Tip-of-the-week

You may be surprised at how many people reuse their passwords for accounts and services. The safest and probably best way to secure any/all of your online accounts is to use a password manager that randomly generates a complex password and stores it for you. There are phone or web apps and they may be bothersome but you will be glad you used one if the day ever comes where whatever service you used was comprimised and your password, which could have been stored in plain-text, is stolen. Password Managers!

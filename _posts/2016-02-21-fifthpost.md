This past week my partner and finished project 2 with a whopping 3 hours to spare. Surprisingly project 2 was not as hard as project 1, but I think that may have been because, as a team, we filled in the knowledge we lacked. Often, when he didnt know the answer to something, I would and vise-versa. I am wondering if we did everything correctly because I was expecting it to be a little more difficult, but we haven't had to resubmit. 

Currently in my way are interviews. I know they are supposed to be a good thing, but they are just in the way of school word and exams. An extra thing that you have to study and worry for. 

Next week I have an exam for Numerical Analysis and perhaps begin studying for the exam for this class.

This week was pretty great.

Tip-of-the-week

My tip of the week is to actually work with your partner. The reason why they say "two head are better than one" is because two heads are actually better than one. This week reminded me of that.

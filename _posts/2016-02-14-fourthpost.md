title: Week 4
---

This past week we started project 2. We set down the barebones skeleton for the project so that we can actually just focus on the the algorithm this upcoming week. It wasnt too difficult to start from scratch. A lot of things were similar to project 1. We have been looking through the caches and seeing which one would be the most convinient. We also thought about making our own. Would that be too difficult? Maybe. I'll experiment.

In my way at the moment is learning what the coverage do can fully do. I didnt spend too much time on it last project and I want to read more about it this week. 

Next week my partner and I will implement the algorithm and the caches we have been thinking of using. These issues on Github are pretty nifty. They kind of set the guidelines and things we need to accomplish. 

This week I was called on and didnt know the answer to the question. Ha.

Tip-of-the-week

You can close issues by committing "fixes #issue number" to your github project and pushing them to the master. Its pretty simple.

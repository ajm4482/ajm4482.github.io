This past week was our first exam. I think it went well, probably. There was a question or two that made me wish I studied better but that happens all the time. The exam was completely do-able and there were no extreme curve balls. It was a good first exam. 

Currently in my way are those decisions where you predict how well you are going to do in each class. I have had my first exams for all my classes and now it is time to decide if I should keep them. 

Next week, I wish to join a team for project 3 and start on it; hopefully get a lot of it done so I can enjoy spring break. I also hope to learn a bit more about Jekyll so that I can create my own theme for it. It doesnt seem too difficult. 

Tip-of-the-week

OpenCV is an open source computer vision library that has interfaces for C/C++, Python, and Java. It is a good place to start if you are interested in computer vision. OpenCV includes algorithms that stitch images, train object detection and even has video encoding/decoding.

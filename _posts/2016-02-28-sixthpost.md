Unpacking, unpacking, unpacking. This past week I was called on while I was day dreaming; that rush of adrenaline when you don't know whats happening is great. Good thing about it is if I ever forget what unpacking is, I can always recall humilation and remember what it is. Emotional binding is a strong thing! I also had my Numerical Analysis midterm.

In my way are the countless other things that are not my Software Engineering exam. I am also waiting to gain access to an open source project that I need for a class. Can't really start until then. Roadblock.

Next week I will do good on my SE exam. Next week I will do good on my SE exam. Next week I will do good on my SE exam. Next week I will do good on my SE exam. Maybe if I repeat it enough, it will motivate me to study early.

Tip-of-the-week

I had an interview through hackerrank.com and after the interview I checked it out. It is actually a pretty neat site to prepare for interviews. It warms you up for any coding that may take place and it uses a point system to make you want more points. Sort of like an addiction.

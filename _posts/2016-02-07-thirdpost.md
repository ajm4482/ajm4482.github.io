title: Week 3 
---

This past week was the career fair. I was able to land a couple of interviews and am hoping for the best. Regardless of finding an internship, this Summer will probably be spent bringing in money and coding; even if they arent done at the same time. I also finished the Collatz project 1 for this class. I have learned a lot from this class already and most of it will probably be extremely useful.

Currently in my way is nothing. Nothing is blocking my path and if anything would be challenging it, it would probably be my laid-back attitude and procrastination that I could never really completely shake off. I should start on homework earlier so that everything does not pile up. Every year I make the promise to change and as always, eventually it is forgotten. 

Next week I will start on all of my homework early! I also need to reach out to professors and developers. My information security project needs to progress and the only way that is going to happen, is if I talk to experts and professionals. I need to follow up on my communication with Anonize. This week, I will probably study their application and see the cryptology behind it.

My experience in the class can only be described positively. Learning, building experience, coding.

Tip-of-the-week

Anonize is an app to take truly anonymous surveys. Apps like these, e.g. SurveyMonkey, Google, etc, are not actually anonymous. There are always ways to link your identity to the survey and if someone really wanted to, they could, potentially, discover who you really were. Anonize solves that and leaves no trace behind.

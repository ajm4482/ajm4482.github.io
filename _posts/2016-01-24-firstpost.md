I joined a new organization this semester so this first week was introducing myself to it, a lot more time consuming than I was expecting. As the first week of class has ended, I now have several more text books and several less dollars. 

In my way is my ISP whom have been cutting my internet off randomly in small intervals. Just watch it happen one day when I am rushing to submit an assignment by midnight, and no internet. 

The first week of school is, of course, the easiest throughout the semester. The second week is when you begin to realize things are going to speed up faster than you will be prepared. So next week, I will be preparing for the accelearation that will come. 

This is my first class with Downing and I am expecting to learn a lot of useful things in his class. Already from the first class day, I can see he is an excellent professor.

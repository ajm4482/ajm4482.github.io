title: Week 8

This past week I met and worked with my team. There were a couple of new things I had not worked with before: AngularJS, Flask. Carina was a little difficult to understand at first and troublesome. I also have a good team and am looking forward to working with them some more. 

Currently in my way are these pesky quizes. I did not do so hot this week. Kind of worried that it might bring my grade down signnificantly if I continue to reck them. Note to self, prepare more for quizzes.

Next week is Spring break week. I will probably work on this project throughout the week. Our team has made good progress and we may even have a rough final by the end of the week. 

Tip-of-the-week

Eddystone is Google's open source, cross-platform bluetooth beacon format. Beacons are beginning to boom and can actually be useful. Data can be trasmitted within a proximity threshold; the most common examply is it being put to use commercially.
